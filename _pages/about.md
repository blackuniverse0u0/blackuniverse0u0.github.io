## Hi there 👋

I'm a **robotics engineer** passionate about building intelligent autonomous systems that bridge the gap between **perception**, **planning**, and **control**. My work spans the full robotics stack—from low-level control theory and rigid body dynamics to high-level AI and deep reinforcement learning.

## What I Do

I specialize in three core areas of robotics:

### 🤖 Autonomous Navigation & Planning
- **Semantic Perception**: Training vision models (SegFormer, Vision Transformers) for scene understanding
- **Motion Planning**: BEV-MPPI, Dynamic Window Approach, and learning-based planners
- **End-to-End Learning**: Imitation learning and behavior cloning for autonomous navigation

**Current Focus**: [SideWalker](/projects/) - Urban sidewalk navigation with semantic segmentation and MPPI control

### 🦿 Legged Locomotion & Control
- **Classical Control**: Model Predictive Control (MPC), inverse kinematics, trajectory optimization
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Training quadruped gaits with PPO and JAX-accelerated simulation
- **Mathematical Foundations**: Lie groups (SO(3), SE(3)), screw theory, rigid body dynamics

**Philosophy**: Understanding the "why" behind every algorithm—from rotation matrices to policy gradients

### 📹 Computer Vision & Deployment
- **Object Detection & Tracking**: YOLO-based detection with PD control for gimbal tracking
- **Production Systems**: Docker-based deployment with TensorRT optimization for embedded GPUs
- **Video Streaming**: Low-latency WebRTC streaming for real-time robot teleoperation

**Production Experience**: Deployed AI tracking systems on defense robots with <100ms latency

## Technical Expertise

**Programming & Frameworks**
- Python, C++, JAX, PyTorch
- ROS/ROS2, Docker, Git

**Robotics & Control**
- MuJoCo, Gazebo simulation
- MPC, MPPI, PID control
- Forward/Inverse Kinematics

**Machine Learning**
- Deep Reinforcement Learning (PPO, SAC)
- Imitation Learning & Behavior Cloning
- Computer Vision (Semantic Segmentation, Object Detection)

**Hardware & Systems**
- NVIDIA Jetson (Xavier, Orin)
- Unitree Go1/A1 Quadrupeds
- Intel RealSense D435i
- PTZ Cameras & Gimbals

## Learning Philosophy

> "Don't just use tools—understand how they work."

I believe in:
- **First-principles thinking**: Deriving equations instead of copy-pasting code
- **End-to-end understanding**: From mathematical theory to working hardware
- **Open exploration**: Trying multiple approaches (model-based + learning-based)
- **Real-world validation**: Simulation is just the beginning—deploy and iterate

## Current Projects

**SideWalker**: Autonomous navigation with semantic BEV + MPPI
**Quadruped Locomotion**: From Lie algebra to PPO-trained gaits
**Gremsy Box**: Production-grade AI tracking for defense robots

Check out my [projects page](/projects/) for detailed technical writeups.

## Research Interests

- **Perceptive Locomotion**: Vision-guided quadruped navigation in complex terrains
- **Sim-to-Real Transfer**: Bridging simulation and reality with domain randomization
- **Whole-Body Control**: Coordinating manipulation and locomotion
- **Long-Horizon Planning**: Multi-modal planners for exploration and autonomy
